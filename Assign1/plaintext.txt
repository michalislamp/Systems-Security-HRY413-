Radio is a form of wireless communication that uses electromagnetic waves to transmit audio signals over long distances. Invented in the late 19th century, radio revolutionized how people accessed news, entertainment, and information, becoming a key medium for mass communication. It works by converting sound into electrical signals, which are then broadcast via radio waves and received by radios that convert them back into sound. Despite the rise of television and the internet, radio remains widely used, particularly in cars, emergency communication, and in areas with limited access to other media.
